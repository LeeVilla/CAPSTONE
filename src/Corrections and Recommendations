AddTransaction.js

Some potential improvements could be:

    Adding some form validation for the input fields to ensure that the "text" and "amount" values are entered correctly.
    Adding some error handling for the case when the API call to add a transaction fails.
    Adding some styling to make the form visually appealing


LoginForm.js

it is missing crucial logic to handle the form data submission. Currently, the form data is only logged to the console, but in a real-world scenario, it should be sent to a backend server for authentication. Also, there is no error handling for invalid submissions.

RegisterForm.js

there are a few areas for improvement:

    The password validation should also check if the match password field is empty, so that the user is prompted to fill in the confirmation password field before submitting the form.

    The code logs the result of the username and password validation to the console, but it's better to remove these log statements in a production environment.

    The error message should be placed near the form and be more prominent so that it's easier for the user to see and understand what went wrong.

routes/users.js

this implementation has several limitations and vulnerabilities, such as the lack of input validation and the use of a hardcoded list of users. In a real-world scenario, this code would need to be improved and extended to meet the needs of the application and to ensure security.
tests/RegisterForm.test.js

a few suggestions:

    Instead of hard-coding the number of expected elements in the render output (e.g. expect(wrapper.find("input").length).toEqual(3);), it would be better to use a class or data-test attribute to select the elements, as the number of elements may change in the future.

    The tests for matching passwords could be refactored to be more descriptive. It would be more clear if the tests described the desired behavior explicitly, such as "should display an error message when the passwords do not match" rather than using expect(wrapper.find(".invalid").length).toEqual(1);.

homeStore.test.js

there's one thing to consider:

    The debounce function is mentioned in the comment, but it's not clear if it's used correctly. It might be worth adding a test to verify this.
